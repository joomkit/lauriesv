&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is Online Therapy Suitable for you?
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online therapy can be convenient. It obviates the need for travel, can
enable flexible appointments at short notice, can be conducted from any
location with suitable network coverage, and enables you to continue
therapy even when you are unable to physically leave your home.
However, before agreeing to proceed with online therapy you might
consider the following:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do you currently feel able to discuss what might be a difficult or
emotionally troubling issue with a therapist via the telephone or a
video link?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do you have a place, or time in your home, when you can be alone
and feel able to talk without being overheard or interrupted for 50
minutes?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do you have access to suitable technology, a computer or laptop,
tablet or smartphone that you are able to use?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do you have broadband, Wi-Fi, good mobile network coverage, or a
land line telephone available to you?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do you have headphones or earphones that can be used with your
computer or smartphone?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Should you need physical assistance during your therapy session is
there anyone nearby that the therapist could call to assist you?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are uncertain about how to answer any of the above questions
please contact me with your concerns before booking an appointment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type of Therapy
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mode of therapy I practice may be classified as Integrative. My
methods are primarily brief and solution focused, but attention is paid to
conscious and unconscious processing, personality functioning, as well as
relational and contextual factors connected to the issue you bring to
therapy. (please see web site for more information about how I work)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therapy sessions are client driven, I will work with the issues you bring
to therapy, rather than tell you what you should be addressing. I work
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;				&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;			&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;		&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;		&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;			&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;				&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with the idea that you are willingly seeking therapy, you will be open and
transparent during our work together, and you have a desired outcome
in mind.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am registered with the United Kingdom Council for Psychotherapy
(UKCP) as a psychotherapist and supervisor and Accredited with British
Association of Counsellors and Psychotherapists(BACP) and work to their
code of ethics and professional practices.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapy Sessions
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therapy sessions are offered via video and or telephone. They are 50
minutes in duration, and initially I expect to work with clients at least
once per week but towards the end of therapy we can space the sessions
as appropriate. Sessions are normally scheduled for the same day and
time each week. However, for people who work shifts, or who are unable
to work to a fixed schedule, I endeavour to meet their individual needs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appointments are available on week days and in exceptional
circumstances at the weekend, by prior arrangement. Please be flexible
when booking your session time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Booking an Appointment
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may book appointments by telephone, email or text message. When
you request an appointment you should request an appointment giving a
few dates and times when you are available. I will respond to your
request by email giving you the date and start time, or offering you a list
of alternative appointment dates or times.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you prefer to have a set time and day for your appointments each
week, this can be achieved by block booking your sessions. You may
block book sessions at anytime.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to your request, I will send you an invoice enabling you to
make a payment by bank transfer. If self funding please pay for the
session on the day of the session and use the name the session is
booked in as your reference.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will also send you an appointment confirmation email and a link to join
the session will be emailed on the day of the session.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cancelling an Appointment
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To cancel a scheduled appointment without charge, the cancellation
must be made by email, text or telephone at least 48 hours before the
scheduled start time and as much notice as possible is appreciated.
Cancellations made within 48 hours of an appointment will be charged at the agreed session price.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;				&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;			&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;			&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;				&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rescheduling an Appointment
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appointments rescheduled &lt;strong&gt;at least 48 hours before the scheduled
start time &lt;/strong&gt;may be rescheduled to any date in the future without charge,
if a free slot is available on the desired date.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may reschedule an appointment &lt;strong&gt;within 48 hours of the
appointment start time &lt;/strong&gt;if a free slot is available during the same day
or any day during the same week as the original appointment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that you cannot reschedule an appointment after it’s original
start time has passed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extended and unforeseen absence from therapy
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you intend to interrupt therapy for two or more consecutive sessions
please discuss this with me as soon as possible.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I am unable to attend a scheduled session I will give you as much
notice as possible by email, telephone or text. If I do not attend a
session and you are unable to contact me by telephone, email, or text,
please email lauriemacdonald@me.com with your client reference in the
Subject Line of the email and the date and time of your appointment. We
will contact you within 72 hours of receipt of your email, and you will not
be charged for the session.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ending Therapy
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may end therapy at any time, but it is usual to discuss this with me
at least one week before the final session.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fees and Payment For Self funding Clients
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fees per session are shown below. If covered by an insurance policy
your insurers will be invoiced directly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fees for supervision are discussed on an individual basis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For online or telephone sessions, you will be sent an invoice by email
once you book an appointment. Payments can be made by bank transfer
and should be made to the account on the invoice. Bank transfer
payments should be made on the day of the session. You may also block
book sessions and pay for them by bank transfer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;				&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;			&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;		&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;		&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;							&lt;strong&gt;Privacy and Confidentiality
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therapy sessions are conducted under strict rules of confidentiality. I will
not disclose information that may identify you without your consent,
unless legally bound to do so. For example if it is necessary to contact
your doctor, or legal representative I will first seek your permission.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From time to time I may discuss your case with my supervisor during
supervision. However, no information will be disclosed that will explicitly
identify you.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For insurance purposes I am obliged to keep brief notes of our sessions.
Any notes that I may make will be stored securely for up to five years
and will not be made available to third parties unless mandated by law
or at your request. After five years any notes will be destroyed. This is in
accordance with General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) applicable
within the UK and European Union.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ask me to email your notes to your legal representative, the
probation service, or a case worker, the contents of the email will be
encrypted and password protected. Alternatively the notes will be sent
by post.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must also abide by the rules of confidentiality, and must not record
or make available the contents of our online sessions without my written
consent. This explicitly means that you MUST NOT record or live stream
our video or audio sessions, post any part of our sessions on social
media, or arrange for others to do the same without my written consent.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your sessions are for you alone, therefore others including young
children should not be present during your online or telephone therapy
sessions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be aware that I will never request your personal information or
bank account details by email or text. I will never ask you to complete
an online form without discussing it with you first. I will never ask
another person to contact you on my behalf for the purpose of obtaining
your personal information or requesting payment. I will only ever send
you an invoice in response to a specific appointment request, and you
should only ever make payment to the account on the invoice.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making contact
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before your first online session you will receive an appointment
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;				&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;			&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;		&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;		&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;			&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;				&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;confirmation email with the date and time of your appointment, and
instructions on how to join the session.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will need a Computer, Tablet, or Smartphone to join a video session.
The Zoom application is used for video sessions. You DO NOT need a
Zoom account to use the Zoom application, and before your first session
you will be prompted to download the app once you click on the meeting
invitation link.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For best results, I recommend that you sit in a reasonably well-lit
location, and that you use headphones or earphones for best sound
quality, and to reduce the risk of our conversation being overheard.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please ensure that the battery on any portable devices (laptop, phone,
headphones, earphones) you intend to use is fully charged before you
join the session.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you experience difficulty joining the session please contact me by
email, telephone or text. The telephone numbers and email address are
at the top of this document.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connection failure
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your sound or video quality degrades, for example intermittent
freezing, loss of sound, or total disconnection. This may be caused by
power or device failure, excessive traffic on your local network (within
your home) or the internet in your area. I recommend that you have an
alternative means of contact to hand. For example a mobile phone or
landline. Should our video connection become unstable please disconnect
and contact me on the mobile or landline number above.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making a Complaint
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If for any reason you are dissatisfied with the service I provide, please
advise me in writing at your earliest convenience. I will endeavour to
address your complaint, but should my endeavours be deemed
insufficient, you may make a formal complaint to the United Kingdom
Council for Psychotherapy (UKCP).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you should do if you want to make an appointment
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;










&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reply to the email containing this agreement with the word
‘Agreed’ written in the subject line of the email.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unless we have already agreed a date and time, request an
appointment date and time in your reply.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I will respond to your request by email, giving you the date and
start time, or offering you a list of alternative dates or times.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I will send you an invoice for the session. Details of how to make
payment are at the foot of the invoice. You must pay for the
session on the day of the session.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I will send you an appointment confirmation email and on the day
of the session a link to join the session.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to speaking with you soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yours sincerely,
&lt;/p&gt;

              (UKCP) as a psychotherapist and supervisor and Accredited with British
              Association of Counsellors and Psychotherapists(BACP) and work to their
              code of ethics and professional practices.
            </p>
            <h3><strong>Therapy Sessions
            </strong></h3>
            <p>Therapy sessions are offered via video and or telephone. They are 50
              minutes in duration, and initially I expect to work with clients at least
              once per week but towards the end of therapy we can space the sessions
              as appropriate. Sessions are normally scheduled for the same day and
              time each week. However, for people who work shifts, or who are unable
              to work to a fixed schedule, I endeavour to meet their individual needs.
            </p>
            <p>Appointments are available on week days and in exceptional
              circumstances at the weekend, by prior arrangement. Please be flexible
              when booking your session time.
            </p>
            <h3><strong>Booking an Appointment
            </strong></h3>
            <p>You may book appointments by telephone, email or text message. When
              you request an appointment you should request an appointment giving a
              few dates and times when you are available. I will respond to your
              request by email giving you the date and start time, or offering you a list
              of alternative appointment dates or times.
            </p>
            <p>If you prefer to have a set time and day for your appointments each
              week, this can be achieved by block booking your sessions. You may
              block book sessions at anytime.
            </p>
            <p>In response to your request, I will send you an invoice enabling you to
              make a payment by bank transfer. If self funding please pay for the
              session on the day of the session and use the name the session is
              booked in as your reference.
            </p>
            <p>I will also send you an appointment confirmation email and a link to join
              the session will be emailed on the day of the session.
            </p>
            <h3><strong>Cancelling an Appointment
            </strong></h3>
            <p>To cancel a scheduled appointment without charge, the cancellation
              must be made by email, text or telephone at least 48 hours before the
              scheduled start time and as much notice as possible is appreciated.
              Cancellations made within 48 hours of an appointment will be charged at the agreed session price.
            </p>
            <p>				</p>
            <p>			</p>
            <p>			</p>
            <p>				</p>
            <h3><strong>Rescheduling an Appointment
            </strong></h3>
            <p>Appointments rescheduled <strong>at least 48 hours before the scheduled
              start time </strong>may be rescheduled to any date in the future without charge,
              if a free slot is available on the desired date.
            </p>
            <p>You may reschedule an appointment <strong>within 48 hours of the
              appointment start time </strong>if a free slot is available during the same day
              or any day during the same week as the original appointment.
            </p>
            <p>Please note that you cannot reschedule an appointment after it’s original
              start time has passed.
            </p>
            <h3><strong>Extended and unforeseen absence from therapy
            </strong></h3>
            <p>If you intend to interrupt therapy for two or more consecutive sessions
              please discuss this with me as soon as possible.
            </p>
            <p>If I am unable to attend a scheduled session I will give you as much
              notice as possible by email, telephone or text. If I do not attend a
              session and you are unable to contact me by telephone, email, or text,
              please email lauriemacdonald@me.com with your client reference in the
              Subject Line of the email and the date and time of your appointment. We
              will contact you within 72 hours of receipt of your email, and you will not
              be charged for the session.
            </p>
            <h3><strong>Ending Therapy
            </strong></h3>
            <p>You may end therapy at any time, but it is usual to discuss this with me
              at least one week before the final session.
            </p>
            <h3><strong>Fees and Payment For Self funding Clients
            </strong></h3>
            <p>Fees per session are shown below. If covered by an insurance policy
              your insurers will be invoiced directly.
            </p>
            <p>Fees for supervision are discussed on an individual basis.
            </p>
            <p>For online or telephone sessions, you will be sent an invoice by email
              once you book an appointment. Payments can be made by bank transfer
              and should be made to the account on the invoice. Bank transfer
              payments should be made on the day of the session. You may also block
              book sessions and pay for them by bank transfer.
            </p>

            <p>		</p>
            <h3>							<strong>Privacy and Confidentiality
            </strong></h3>
            <p>Therapy sessions are conducted under strict rules of confidentiality. I will
              not disclose information that may identify you without your consent,
              unless legally bound to do so. For example if it is necessary to contact
              your doctor, or legal representative I will first seek your permission.
            </p>
            <p>From time to time I may discuss your case with my supervisor during
              supervision. However, no information will be disclosed that will explicitly
              identify you.
            </p>
            <p>For insurance purposes I am obliged to keep brief notes of our sessions.
              Any notes that I may make will be stored securely for up to five years
              and will not be made available to third parties unless mandated by law
              or at your request. After five years any notes will be destroyed. This is in
              accordance with General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) applicable
              within the UK and European Union.
            </p>
            <p>If you ask me to email your notes to your legal representative, the
              probation service, or a case worker, the contents of the email will be
              encrypted and password protected. Alternatively the notes will be sent
              by post.
            </p>
            <p>You must also abide by the rules of confidentiality, and must not record
              or make available the contents of our online sessions without my written
              consent. This explicitly means that you MUST NOT record or live stream
              our video or audio sessions, post any part of our sessions on social
              media, or arrange for others to do the same without my written consent.
            </p>
            <p>Your sessions are for you alone, therefore others including young
              children should not be present during your online or telephone therapy
              sessions.
            </p>
            <p>Please be aware that I will never request your personal information or
              bank account details by email or text. I will never ask you to complete
              an online form without discussing it with you first. I will never ask
              another person to contact you on my behalf for the purpose of obtaining
              your personal information or requesting payment. I will only ever send
              you an invoice in response to a specific appointment request, and you
              should only ever make payment to the account on the invoice.
            </p>
            <h3><strong>Making contact
            </strong></h3>
            <p>Before your first online session you will receive an appointment
            </p>
            <p>				</p>
            <p>			</p>
            <p>		</p>
            <p>		</p>
            <p>			</p>
            <p>				</p>
            <p>confirmation email with the date and time of your appointment, and
              instructions on how to join the session.
            </p>
            <p>You will need a Computer, Tablet, or Smartphone to join a video session.
              The Zoom application is used for video sessions. You DO NOT need a
              Zoom account to use the Zoom application, and before your first session
              you will be prompted to download the app once you click on the meeting
              invitation link.
            </p>
            <p>For best results, I recommend that you sit in a reasonably well-lit
              location, and that you use headphones or earphones for best sound
              quality, and to reduce the risk of our conversation being overheard.
            </p>
            <p>Please ensure that the battery on any portable devices (laptop, phone,
              headphones, earphones) you intend to use is fully charged before you
              join the session.
            </p>
            <p>If you experience difficulty joining the session please contact me by
              email, telephone or text. The telephone numbers and email address are
              at the top of this document.
            </p>
            <h3><strong>Connection failure
            </strong></h3>
            <p>If your sound or video quality degrades, for example intermittent
              freezing, loss of sound, or total disconnection. This may be caused by
              power or device failure, excessive traffic on your local network (within
              your home) or the internet in your area. I recommend that you have an
              alternative means of contact to hand. For example a mobile phone or
              landline. Should our video connection become unstable please disconnect
              and contact me on the mobile or landline number above.
            </p>
            <h3><strong>Making a Complaint
            </strong></h3>
            <p>If for any reason you are dissatisfied with the service I provide, please
              advise me in writing at your earliest convenience. I will endeavour to
              address your complaint, but should my endeavours be deemed
              insufficient, you may make a formal complaint to the United Kingdom
              Council for Psychotherapy (UKCP).
            </p>
